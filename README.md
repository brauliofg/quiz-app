## Description

Quiz App was created with the intention of learning ReactJS.
The following goals were achieved in the creation of this project.

- Handling user inputs to create an API request
- Obtaining and using data from an API
- Displaying results to the page by combining user inputs and data from an API
- Basic understanding of CSS and HTML
- Intermediate understanding of Javascript

### Known Bugs

- Some special characters are not displaying correctly (Example: "√É¬©" is shown in place of "√©"). This may be due to how Javascript decodes Base64 strings
- Once the quiz is submitted, the non-selected answers and incorrectly selected answers show through the header.
